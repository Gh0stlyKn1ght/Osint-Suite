## Overview

The **Osint Suite Installer** is a streamlined, automated Bash script designed for Kali Linux. Its purpose is to install and configure a curated set of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools for investigators, researchers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts. Inspired by the Trace Labs install-tools.sh framework, this script has been updated with modern tools, compatibility checks, and system validation.

This script ensures:

* System prerequisites are installed.
* Tools are not reinstalled if already present.
* Errors are logged.
* A purple progress interface for visual clarity.

## Troubleshooting weybackurls


 You're seeing command not found: waybackurls because the binary installed by go install is located in $HOME/go/bin, which likely isn't in your $PATH.
üîß To fix this:
1. Confirm it's installed

Run:

ls $HOME/go/bin/waybackurls

If it exists, that‚Äôs good.
2. Temporarily use it:

You can run it like this directly:
```
$HOME/go/bin/waybackurls
```

3. üîÅ Permanently fix by adding to PATH:

Append this to your shell config:
```shell
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
If you're using Zsh:

```shell
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
Once done, try:

```shell
waybackurls testphp.vulnweb.com`
```
